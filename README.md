Composition-OOP-vs-Functional
=============================

This is a small example written in C# that has a simple composition using shapes, and computes the area for the given shape. There is an accompanying project in F# which does the same thing.

The purpose of this is to illustrate how functional techniques/languages cut away some of the ceremony involved in C#.
